This skeleton demonstrates how to use the \texttt{infthesis} style for
MSc dissertations in the School of Informatics. It also emphasises the
page limit and associated style restrictions for Informatics dissertations
with course code \texttt{INFR11077}. If your degree has a different project
course code, then it is likely to have different formatting rules.
The file \texttt{skeleton.tex} generates this document and should be used as a
starting point for your thesis. Replace this abstract text with a concise
