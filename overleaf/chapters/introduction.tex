The preliminary material of your report should contain:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The title page.
\item
An abstract page.
\item
Declaration of ethics and own work.
\item
Optionally an acknowledgements page.
\item
The table of contents.
\end{itemize}

As in this example \texttt{skeleton.tex}, the above material should be
included between:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{preliminary}
    ...
\end{preliminary}
\end{verbatim}
This style file uses roman numeral page numbers for the preliminary material.

The main content of the dissertation, starting with the first chapter,
starts with page~1. \emph{\textbf{The main content must not go beyond page~40.}}

The report then contains a bibliography and any appendices, which may go beyond
page~40. The appendices are only for any supporting material that's important to
go on record. However, you cannot assume markers of dissertations will read them.

You may not change the dissertation format (e.g., reduce the font size, change
the margins, or reduce the line spacing from the default 1.5 spacing). Be
careful if you copy-paste packages into your document preamble from elsewhere.
Some \LaTeX{} packages, such as \texttt{fullpage} or \texttt{savetrees}, change
the margins of your document. Do not include them!

Over-length or incorrectly-formatted dissertations will not be accepted and you
would have to modify your dissertation and resubmit. You cannot assume we will
check your submission before the final deadline and if it requires resubmission
after the deadline to conform to the page and style requirements you will be
subject to the usual late penalties based on your final submission time.

\section{Using Sections}

Divide your chapters into sub-parts as appropriate.

\section{Citations}

Citations (such as \cite{P1} or \cite{P2}) can be generated using
\texttt{BibTeX}. For more advanced usage, we recommend using the \texttt{natbib}
package or the newer \texttt{biblatex} system.

These examples use a numerical citation style. You may use any consistent
reference style that you prefer, including ``(Author, Year)'' citations.
