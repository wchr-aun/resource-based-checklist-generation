The body of your dissertation, before the references and any appendices,
\emph{must} finish by page~40. The introduction, after preliminary material,
should have started on page~1.

You may not change the dissertation format (e.g., reduce the font size, change
the margins, or reduce the line spacing from the default 1.5 spacing). Be
careful if you copy-paste packages into your document preamble from elsewhere.
Some \LaTeX{} packages, such as \texttt{fullpage} or \texttt{savetrees}, change
the margins of your document. Do not include them!

Over-length or incorrectly-formatted dissertations will not be accepted and you
would have to modify your dissertation and resubmit. You cannot assume we will
check your submission before the final deadline and if it requires resubmission
after the deadline to conform to the page and style requirements you will be
subject to the usual late penalties based on your final submission time.
