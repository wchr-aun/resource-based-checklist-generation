# Implementation of a Resource-based Checklist Generation

## Abstract
This project aimed towards building a resource-based checklist generation tool for WorkflowFM that can utilise WorkflowFM’s advantages of containing the specification of processes. WorkflowFM is a logic-based workflow management framework that guarantees the correctness and consistency of the workflow through well-defined structures of processes. A workflow is a streamline of processes that performs predefined works. Our checklist generation tool supports various kinds of processes with inputs and outputs of arbitrary complexity. This tool provides two main benefits outside of creating checklists. First, it provides an automatic checklist generation feature to support users, which reduces the number of procedures in checklist creation. Second, it can bind the values of checklist elements to the information flow (inputs and outputs) in the workflow in order to transfer those values to next processes. After the implementation of the prototype, questionnaires and tasks were used to evaluate the usability and functionality of this prototype. This prototype got a System Usability Scale score of 64.82 — and a mean correctness of 91% with a standard deviation of 10% on the final task, which is a good indicator that this tool works as expected. This project has the potential to benefit the research team of WorkflowFM and businesses that are using WorkflowFM, such as the National Health Service and manufacturing companies, with a checklist generation tool that not only can receive human inputs but also help automatically generate checklists.
